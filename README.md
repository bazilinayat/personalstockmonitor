I have been learning about the stock market and how to identify candles, swings, patterns and the works...

For the last some weeks I have been tracking my practice on an excel sheet to maintain a record of things like pass, fail,
patterns, price etc.

I wanted a better way to manage, rather than creating a new excel for each month, colour coding, adding details, formatting 
It was just too much work

So I instead thought of creating this MAUI application for keeping track of things better

What it will be able to do?

1. Upload and keep company details that come under - NIFTY50, NIFTY100, NIFTY200, NIFTY500, FUTURES
Upload will be done from .csv files, which are downloaded from NSE website

2. Select a random company under any of these 5 or search for a company symbol
Write down the details, like which remark are you making daily, weekly or monthly
Your position, your prediction and any notes

3. The application will display a list of charts that you have checked based on the checking date
And you can open them and give your results

4. Planning to add some graphs to track the success and faiilure rate in a better way 
Not sure yet how it will be done

The database is sqlite as it will be on the machine itself
